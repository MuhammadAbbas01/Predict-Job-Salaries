# Predicting Job Salaries Based on Experience, Employment Type, and Geographic Data

## Project Overview
This project aims to predict job salaries using socio-economic and regional data, including experience level, employment type, job titles, salary, and geographic factors. By applying various machine learning models, we analyze and compare model performance to determine the best approach for salary prediction.

## Data
The dataset includes information on:
- Experience level and job title
- Employment type and salary (in USD)
- Geographic location of employees and companies
- Company size and remote work ratio

## Models and Results
We tested several models:
- **Linear Regression** 
- **Lasso and Ridge Regression**
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**
- **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**
- **Random Forest**

Each model‚Äôs performance was evaluated using Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R¬≤ Score. Detailed metrics for each model can be found in the report.

## Conclusion
The model comparison suggests that **SVM** and **Random Forest** provided the best predictive accuracy on this dataset. Further tuning and feature engineering could enhance performance.

## Next Steps
- Fine-tune hyperparameters for optimized performance
- Explore additional socio-economic data features
- Test with larger datasets for improved generalization

## Key Insights
- Model performance varies widely depending on model choice and parameter settings
- Regional and job-specific factors significantly influence salary prediction

## Suggestions
For future iterations, consider incorporating additional data sources and more sophisticated models, such as ensemble methods or deep learning architectures.
